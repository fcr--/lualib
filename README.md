# lualib
Random libraries I write on my free time and I reuse on several projects

Eventually I will upload this into luarocks, since it becomes a bit annoying having to create a symbolic link pointing to the `lualib` sub directory for every `share/lua/5.1/` environment (hint: that's how it can be currently installed).

This was tested with at least luajit and lua 5.3.
